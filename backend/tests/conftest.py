"""The database configuration relies on module globals and as such is a bit fragile, but
it works and hopefully doesn't need to be adjusted too often. We use the pytest-env plugin
to set the `HTV_BACKEND_DATABASE_URI` environment variables to a separate SQLite file when
running tests and use pytest hooks to start a transaction before individual tests are
executed and rollback any changes after execution. In order to test API routes, we make use
of Flaskâ€™s built-in test client."""
