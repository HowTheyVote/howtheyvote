    The European Union is one of
    the largest democracies in the world.The European Parliament, with its 720 members from the EU’s
    27 member states, represents just over 440 million Europeans. Although the Parliament publishes
    information such as agendas, minutes, and vote results on its website, it can be quite difficult
    to find out what MEPs voted on or how a particular vote turned out. HowTheyVote.eu compiles voting
    data from various official sources and allows anyone to search for votes and view the results.
    This feed provides the 200 newest votes in our database.
