# Create font subset

The `subset.sh` script can be used to create a subset of the IBM Plex Sans variable font including all characters required to display text in official languages of the EU member states. The exact Unicode ranges are defined in `unicode-ranges.txt`.

You need `uv` installed on your system to run the script.
